'''Task 1
i. Write a program which can read a list of students with their roll numbers and save
it in the form of dictionary with {rollnumber:Name}must have at least 10 students with
name and roll number.
ii. Save this file as my_friends.txt.
iii. From this file now read each name and find vowels used in each student name.
iv. Find the maximum and minimum names with vowels in the list and save it in the same
file with the text on the top The Max and Min Vowels. For example: Ali got 2 vowels so itâ€™s
 the smallest whereas Syed Muhammad Jibran Ali will have 8 vowels will come as maximum.'''
